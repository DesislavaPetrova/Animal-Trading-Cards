			<p id="important-information"> Giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! 
				They often archieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time.

			<p> Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humans - about 6 feet.
				No one has towered over these creatures since the time of the dinosaurs. Standing over 18 ft. tall, these
				creatures are long-necked and long-legged, making these lanky animals perfectly build for browsing on tall
				trees and branches, taking advantage of food sources other herbivores cannot.
